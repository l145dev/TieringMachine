# Tiering Machine

A dystopian Social Credit System simulation where citizens are ranked, judged, and tiered based on their behavior.

## Overview

Tiering Machine simulates a society where every action is monitored and scored. It features an AI-powered judicial system that evaluates reports and assigns point penalties or rewards, determining a citizen's social standing.

## Architecture

The project is divided into three main components:

- **[Client](./client/README.md)**: A React-based frontend providing the user interface for citizens and administrators.
- **[Server](./server/README.md)**: A Spring Boot backend handling logic, AI integration, and data persistence.
- **[Database](./database/README.md)**: PostgreSQL database schema and data.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Material UI, React Three Fiber
- **Backend**: Java 21, Spring Boot 3.2, Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Groq API (Llama 3.1)
- **DevOps**: Docker
